The code is a simple game of **rock-paper-scissors** between the user and the computer. The code does the following:

- It defines three variables, `rock`, `paper`, and `scissors`, which store the ASCII art representations of the three choices.
- It creates a list, `choice_list`, which contains the three variables, and a variable, `choice_num`, which stores the length of the list.
- It asks the user to enter a number between 0 and 2, corresponding to one of the choices, and assigns it to a variable, `player_choice`.
- It prints the user's choice using the `choice_list` and the `player_choice` variables.
- It generates a random number between 0 and 2, corresponding to the computer's choice, and assigns it to a variable, `computer_choice`.
- It prints the computer's choice using the `choice_list` and the `computer_choice` variables.
- It compares the `player_choice` and the `computer_choice` variables using a series of if-elif-else statements, and prints the outcome of the game. The rules are as follows:
    - Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
    - If the choices are the same, it is a tie.
    - The user wins if their choice beats the computer's choice, and loses otherwise.
