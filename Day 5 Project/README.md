This code generates random passwords based on the userâ€™s input. It has two levels of difficulty: easy and hard.

The easy level generates a password by concatenating a number of letters, symbols, and numbers chosen randomly from predefined lists. The order of the characters is not randomised, so the password will always start with letters, followed by numbers, and then symbols. For example, if the user inputs 4 letters, 2 symbols, and 2 numbers, the password might look like JduE&!91.

The hard level generates a password by first creating an easy level password, and then shuffling the characters randomly. This makes the password more secure and unpredictable
