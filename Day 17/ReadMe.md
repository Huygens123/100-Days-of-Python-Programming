This project implements a simple quiz application with three main parts:

1. Question Model: Defines the structure for quiz questions
2. Data: Stores the actual questions and answers
3. Quiz Brain: Handles the quiz logic and flow

The code first creates a list of Question objects from the provided data. Then it runs a quiz loop that:
- Checks if there are questions remaining
- If yes, presents the next question
- If no, ends the quiz
