A console-based Hangman game. 
It randomly selects a word from a list and prompts the player to guess letters. Correct guesses reveal the letters in the word, while incorrect guesses result in a loss of lives, depicted by ASCII art of a hangman. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses the word or runs out of lives.
